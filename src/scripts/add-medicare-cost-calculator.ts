## Estimate Your Medicare Costs

Use this comprehensive calculator to estimate your Medicare costs and compare different plan options. Our tool helps you understand the financial impact of Medicare coverage and find the most cost-effective plan for your needs.

## How It Works

This calculator uses your personal information to:

- Calculate Part A, B, C, and D premiums
- Estimate Medigap supplement costs
- Factor in income-related adjustments (IRMAA)
- Compare different plan options
- Provide personalized cost estimates

## Understanding Medicare Costs

### Part A (Hospital Insurance)
- **Premium**: Usually $0 if you have enough work credits (40 quarters)
- **Deductible**: $1,632 per benefit period (2024)
- **Covers**: Inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, hospice care

### Part B (Medical Insurance)
- **Premium**: $174.70/month (2024) for most people
- **Deductible**: $240 per year (2024)
- **Covers**: Doctor visits, outpatient care, preventive services

### Part C (Medicare Advantage)
- **Premium**: Varies by plan (may be $0)
