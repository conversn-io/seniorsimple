## Introduction

A reverse mortgage can be a powerful tool for retirees who want to access their home's equity without selling their property. This comprehensive guide will help you understand how reverse mortgages work, their benefits and risks, and how to determine if this strategy is right for your retirement planning.

## What is a Reverse Mortgage?

A reverse mortgage is a loan that allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert part of their home's equity into cash. Unlike traditional mortgages, you don't make monthly payments to the lender. Instead, the loan balance grows over time and is typically repaid when you move out, sell the home, or pass away.

### Key Features
- **No monthly payments required** (though you must maintain the home and pay property taxes and insurance)
- **Loan proceeds are tax-free** (though they may affect eligibility for certain government benefits)
- **Non-recourse loan** (you can never owe more than the home's value)
- **Flexible payment options** (lump sum, monthly payments, line of credit, or combination)

## Types of Reverse Mortgages

### Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)
- **Most common type** - insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
- **Maximum loan amount** - determined by home value, age, and interest rates
- **Required counseling** - borrowers must complete HECM counseling
- **Protection features** - non-recourse, mortgage insurance protection

### Proprietary Reverse Mortgages
- **Higher loan amounts** - for homes valued above FHA limits
- **Private insurance** - not backed by the federal government
- **Variable terms** - terms and conditions vary by lender
- **Higher costs** - may have higher fees and interest rates

### Single-Purpose Reverse Mortgages
- **Limited use** - proceeds can only be used for specific purposes (home repairs, property taxes)
- **Lower costs** - typically offered by state and local government agencies
- **Income restrictions** - may have income and asset limits
- **Limited availability** - not available in all areas

## Benefits of Reverse Mortgages

- Continue living in your current home
- No monthly mortgage payments required
- Maintain ownership and control of your property

### 2. Supplement Retirement Income

### 3. Financial Flexibility

### 4. Estate Planning Benefits
