## Understand and Minimize Estate Taxes to Preserve Your Wealth

Estate taxes can significantly reduce the wealth you pass on to your heirs. This comprehensive guide explains how estate taxes work, current exemption amounts, and strategies to minimize your tax burden while protecting your family's financial future.

## Understanding Estate Taxes

### What is the Estate Tax?

The **estate tax** is a federal tax on the transfer of property at death. It's calculated on the total value of your assets minus allowable deductions and exemptions. The tax is paid by your estate before assets are distributed to your heirs.

**Key Points:**
- Federal estate tax rate: 40% on amounts above exemption
- Current exemption (2024): $13.61 million per person
- Married couples can use both exemptions: $27.22 million
- Portability allows surviving spouse to use deceased spouse's unused exemption
- State estate taxes may also apply

### How Estate Taxes Work

**Taxable Estate Calculation:**
1. **Gross Estate**: Total value of all assets
2. **Minus Deductions**: Debts, funeral expenses, administrative costs
3. **Minus Exemptions**: Federal and state exemption amounts
4. **Taxable Amount**: Amount subject to estate tax
5. **Tax Calculation**: 40% of taxable amount

**Example:**
- Gross estate: $20 million
- Deductions: $500,000
- Exemption: $13.61 million
- Taxable amount: $5.89 million
- Estate tax: $2.356 million (40%)
