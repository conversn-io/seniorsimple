## Ensure Your Assets Go to the Right People

Beneficiary designations are crucial for ensuring your assets are distributed according to your wishes. This comprehensive tool helps you organize, review, and update your beneficiary designations across all your accounts and policies to avoid confusion and ensure your loved ones receive what you intend.

## Understanding Beneficiary Designations

### Types of Beneficiaries

**Primary Beneficiaries:**
